This program uses image recognition (to some extend) to play the dino game in chrome.
It can detect day and night and run in both conditions.
It is quite fast. I have replaced pyautogui with mss which is way faster.
As the speed keeps on increasing, the jump timing is also getting changed in the code.
The dino can reach only upto 700 score for some reason.
A few unknown bugs causes the dino to die in the very initial stage sometimes.
